# Linear-Logistic-Regressions

A certain car company is planning to manufacture and launch a new car. So, the
company’s consultants need to study the factors which the pricing of cars
depends on. Based on various market surveys, the consultants gathered a
dataset of different types of cars across the market. They would like to know
which of the car features are significant in predicting the price of a car.
In addition, they would like to predict whether customers will be interested in
purchasing the new car. That’s why they collected a few records of some of the
company’s previous customers who either purchased a new car from the
company as an upgrade or didn’t purchase a new car.

we are building a linear regression model and a logistic regression
model for this company to predict car prices and purchases based on some
features.
